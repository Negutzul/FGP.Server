Here is the step-by-step "script" of actions for the video. This covers exactly what you need to do to see your data.

The Extension we installed
We installed SQLite Viewer (usually the one by Florian Klampfer).

Why? It allows you to click on .db files and see them instantly as tables, just like Excel, without writing code.

The Script (Step-by-Step Guide)
Step 1: Locate the Database

Open the File Explorer on the left side of VS Code.

Look for your database file (usually named app.db, db.sqlite3, or similar).

Step 2: Open the Database

Single-click the app.db file.

Because you installed the extension, it won't show "binary" garbage anymore. Instead, it will open a clean Grid View in the main window.

Step 3: View Your Data

You will see a list of your Tables (e.g., user, post, inventory).

Click on a table name to expand it.

You can now see the rows (Client A, Client B, stock counts, etc.).

Step 4: Refreshing (Important!)

Note: If you run your Python code and update the stock, the viewer might not update automatically.

There is usually a tiny Refresh Icon (circular arrow) at the top of the viewer table. Click that to see the latest changes after you run a "buy" test.

What to look for right now
Since you are testing the "Race Condition," you should:

Open the inventory table in this viewer.

Look at the stock_count column.

Run your Python "buy" script.

Hit Refresh in the viewer to see if the number went down correctly (or if it went to -1, which means the bug is happening!).
